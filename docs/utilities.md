# 🛠️ Utilities

A selection of helper classes simplifies timing, mutex management and other chores when working with ESP-IDF.

- **BaseThread** – abstract thread wrapper used by HardFOC.
- **Mutex Helpers** – RAII wrappers for thread safety.
- **Timing Utilities** – delay and time measurement helpers.

These utilities are automatically exported when you depend on `iid-espidf` from your component.
