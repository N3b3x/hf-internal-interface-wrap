- Removed variant-specific constants and configurations
- Kept only essential GPIO types used by EspGpio implementation
- Removed non-ESP32 platform fallback code

**Result:** Clean GPIO types file with only ESP32-specific content.

### 10. EspTypes_PIO.h

**Result:** Minimal PIO types file with clean ESP32-specific definitions.

## Key Principles Applied

### 1. ESP32-Only Focus
- All files now serve only the ESP32 platform
- No platform conditionals or fallback code
- No support for non-ESP32 platforms

### 2. Direct ESP-IDF Type Usage
- Removed all unnecessary `hf_*_native_t` type aliases
- Direct usage of ESP-IDF types where appropriate
- No redundant type definitions

### 3. Minimal and Essential
- Kept only types actually used by Esp* implementations
- Removed legacy code and unused definitions
- Clean, focused type definitions

### 4. Consistent Structure
- Uniform header organization across all files
- Consistent naming conventions
- Standard include order and documentation

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Code Clarity
- No more complex platform conditionals
- Clear ESP32-specific type definitions
- Easier to understand and maintain

### 2. Reduced Complexity
- Eliminated redundant type aliases
- Removed unused legacy code
- Simplified build process

### 3. Better Maintainability
- Single source of truth for ESP32 types
- No platform-specific branching
- Easier to update and extend

### 4. Performance
- Reduced compilation time
- Smaller binary size
- No runtime platform checks

## Compliance Status

### ✅ 100% ESP32 Platform Focus
- All files now serve only ESP32 platform
- No non-ESP32 platform code remains
- Clean separation of concerns

### ✅ No Unnecessary Type Aliases
- Removed all `hf_*_native_t` aliases
