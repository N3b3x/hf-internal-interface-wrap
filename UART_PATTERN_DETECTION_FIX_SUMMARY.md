# UART Pattern Detection Test Fix Summary

## Issues Found

1. **Missing Event Queue Usage**: The original test was not properly using the ESP-IDF event queue to detect pattern events. Pattern detection in ESP-IDF v5.5 requires monitoring the event queue for `UART_PATTERN_DET` events.

2. **Incorrect Test Flow**: The test was trying to read data immediately after writing without properly waiting for events. With external loopback, there's a timing issue that needs to be handled through event-driven processing.

3. **Insufficient Interrupt Configuration**: While interrupts were being configured, the test wasn't properly handling the event queue to receive pattern detection notifications.

4. **Two Separate Tests**: The tests `test_uart_pattern_detection()` and `test_uart_pattern_detection_v55()` were duplicating functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Combined Tests into One Comprehensive Test
- Merged `test_uart_pattern_detection()` and `test_uart_pattern_detection_v55()` into a single comprehensive test
- The v55 test now just returns true as a stub since functionality is tested in the main test

### 2. Implemented Event-Driven Pattern Detection
```cpp
// Proper event queue handling
QueueHandle_t event_queue = uart->GetEventQueue();
uart_event_t event;

while (xQueueReceive(event_queue, &event, pdMS_TO_TICKS(100))) {
    switch (event.type) {
        case UART_PATTERN_DET:
            // Handle pattern detection
            int pattern_pos = uart->PopPatternPosition();
            break;
    }
}
```

### 3. Fixed Configuration
- Ensured event queue is enabled in UART configuration (`config.event_queue_size = 32`)
- Properly configured interrupts before enabling pattern detection
- Added proper event queue reset before each test phase

### 4. Improved Test Structure
- Clear separation between line pattern test (`\n`) and AT pattern test (`+++`)
- Proper buffer flushing and event queue clearing between tests
- Better error reporting with detailed pass/fail status for each sub-test
- Added timeout-based event processing loop

### 5. Used Test Framework's Task Support
- Changed to use `RUN_TEST_IN_TASK` macro with 8KB stack size
- This provides more stack space for event processing and prevents stack overflow

## Key Implementation Details for ESP-IDF v5.5

1. **Pattern Detection API**: Uses `uart_enable_pattern_det_baud_intr()` which is the correct API for ESP-IDF v5.5
2. **Event Queue**: Pattern detection events are delivered through the UART event queue, not through direct interrupt callbacks
3. **Pattern Position**: Must call `uart_pattern_pop_pos()` immediately after receiving `UART_PATTERN_DET` event
4. **Data Reading**: Need to read data from UART to clear the buffer and allow proper pattern detection

## Test Execution

The test now:
1. Configures UART with event queue enabled
2. Sets up interrupts for RX FIFO and timeout
3. Enables pattern detection with proper parameters
4. Sends test data through external loopback
5. Monitors event queue for pattern detection events
6. Validates that all expected patterns are detected
7. Reports detailed results for each sub-test

## Expected Behavior

With external loopback (jumper between TX/RX pins):
- Line pattern test should detect 3 patterns from "Line1\nLine2\nLine3\n"
- AT pattern test should detect 2 patterns from the AT command string with embedded "+++" sequences
- Both tests should pass for overall success
